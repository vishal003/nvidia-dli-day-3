    "### The Federalist Papers - History Mystery!\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Federalist Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers) are a set of essays written between 1787 and 1788 by [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton), [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison) and [John Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay).  Initially published under the pseudonym 'Publius', their intent was to encourage the ratification of the then-new Constitution of the United States of America.  In later years, a list emerged where the author of each one of the 85 papers was identified.  Nevertheless, for a subset of these papers the author is still in question.  The problem of the Federalist Papers authorship attribution has been a subject of much research in statistical NLP in the past.   Now you will try to solve this question with your own BERT-based project model.\n",

    "In concrete terms, the problem is identifying, for each one of the disputed papers, whether Alexander Hamilton or James Madison are the authors.  For this exercise, you can assume that each paper has a single author, i.e., that no collaboration took place (though *that* is not 100% certain!), and that each author has a well-defined writing style that is displayed across all the identified papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Project\n",
    "You are provided with labeled `train.tsv` and `dev.tsv` datasets for the project.  There are 10 test sets, one for each of the disputed papers.  All datasets are contained in the `data/federalist_papers_HM` directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"sentence\" is actually a group of sentences of approximately 256 words.  The labels are '0' for HAMILTON and '1' for MADISON.  There are more papers by Hamilton in the example files than by Madison.  The validation set has been created with approximately the same distribution of the two labels as in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build neural networks using NeMo, as you did in Lab 2.  You'll train your model and test it.  Then you'll use provided collation code to see what answers your model gives to the \"history mystery\"! \n",

      "Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States For the Independent Journal .To the People of the State of New York : THE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed , in a state of disunion , from the arms and arts of foreign nations .I shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and , perhaps , still more alarming kind -- those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between the States themselves , and from domestic factions and convulsions .These have been already in some instances slightly anticipated ; but they deserve a more particular and more full investigation .A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that , if these States should either be wholly disunited , or only united in partial confederacies , the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other .To presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their existence , would be to forget that men are ambitious , vindictive , and rapacious .To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent , unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood , would be to disregard the uniform course of human events , and to set at defiance the accumulated experience of ages .The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable .\t0\n",
      "There are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective bodies of society .Of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion -- the jealousy of power , or the desire of equality and safety .There are others which have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence within their spheres .Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between commercial nations .And there are others , not less numerous than either of the former , which take their origin entirely in private passions ; in the attachments , enmities , interests , hopes , and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members .Men of this class , whether the favorites of a king or of a people , have in too many instances abused the confidence they possessed ; and assuming the pretext of some public motive , have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification .The celebrated Pericles , in compliance with the resentment of a prostitute,1 at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of his countrymen , attacked , vanquished , and destroyed the city of the SAMNIANS .The same man , stimulated by private pique against the MEGARENSIANS,2 another nation of Greece , or to avoid a prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of the statuary Phidias,3 or to get rid of the accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the purchase of popularity,4 or from a combination of all these causes , was the primitive author of that famous and fatal war , distinguished in the Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war ; which , after various vicissitudes , intermissions , and renewals , terminated in the ruin of the Athenian commonwealth .\t0\n",
      "The ambitious cardinal , who was prime minister to Henry VIII. , permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,5 entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the influence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of this enterprising and powerful monarch , he precipitated England into a war with France , contrary to the plainest dictates of policy , and at the hazard of the safety and independence , as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his counsels , as of Europe in general .For if there ever was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy , it was the Emperor Charles V. , of whose intrigues Wolsey was at once the instrument and the dupe .The influence which the bigotry of one female,6 the petulance of another,7 and the cabals of a third,8 had in the contemporary policy , ferments , and pacifications , of a considerable part of Europe , are topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally known .To multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the production of great national events , either foreign or domestic , according to their direction , would be an unnecessary waste of time .Those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn , will themselves recollect a variety of instances ; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or extent of that agency .\t0\n",

      "There have been , if I may so express it , almost as many popular as royal wars .The cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have , upon various occasions , dragged their monarchs into war , or continued them in it , contrary to their inclinations , and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the State .In that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA and BOURBON , which so long kept Europe in a flame , it is well known that the antipathies of the English against the French , seconding the ambition , or rather the avarice , of a favorite leader,10 protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy , and for a considerable time in opposition to the views of the court .The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure grown out of commercial considerations , -- the desire of supplanting and the fear of being supplanted , either in particular branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and navigation .From this summary of what has taken place in other countries , whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own , what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy , in a state of separation ? Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections , weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape ?\t0\n",
      "They would , at the same time , be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government , in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy .It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority .The expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors .Small states , or states of less natural strength , under vigorous governments , and with the assistance of disciplined armies , have often triumphed over large states , or states of greater natural strength , which have been destitute of these advantages .Neither the pride nor the safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority .They would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected , to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence .Thus , we should , in a little time , see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World .This , at least , would be the natural course of things ; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just , in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard .These are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a Constitution , the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of a people , or their representatives and delegates , but they are solid conclusions , drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs .\t0\n",
      "Such a point gained from the British government , and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets , would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations , who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade .A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us , in this respect , would arise from the establishment of a federal navy .There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power , at a period not very distant , to create a navy which , if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers , would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties .This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies .A few ships of the line , sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side , would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign , on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended .Our position is , in this respect , a most commanding one .And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country , in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies , it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges .\t0\n"
